## Desription

Note Taker is a site that allows you to create notes and send them to be sent on a server where they are stored remotely. It allows for the notes to be called from that server and to be deleted .
This project was used to demonstrate the ability to use get and push methods to allow a server to access and delete data when directed from a website.

During this project I learned how to use express.js more thuroughly and was able to better understand the functionality behind the get and push methods.
